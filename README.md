# Weekend project: building Google Maps from scratch

**tl;dr** Working at a mapping company, I was tired of still opening Google maps when looking for a place or directions. So I built an minimal, open version of Google Maps web. It uses open-source libraries and Mapbox services.

## Why this project?

My day job involves maps. Lots of them. So why not?

## Tech

- React
- Redux
- Mapbox-gl-js
- Mapbox Assembly.css
- Mapbox Geocoding API
- Mapbox Directions API

## Do it yourself!

All you need to get this working is a [Mapbox token](https://www.mapbox.com/help/create-api-access-token/). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/benjamintd/mapbox-maps). Feel free to fork and contribute!

# What's next?

Turn-by-turn directions, probably.
